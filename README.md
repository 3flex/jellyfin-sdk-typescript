A TypeScript SDK for Jellyfin.

> Warning: This project is under active development, so API changes may occur.

## Install

```sh
npm i --save @jellyfin/sdk
```

or

```sh
yarn add @jellyfin/sdk
```

### Supported Jellyfin Versions

| SDK Version | Jellyfin Version |
|:-:|:-:|
| 0.8.1 | 10.8.1 - 10.8.9 |
| 0.8.0 | 10.8.1 - 10.8.9 |
| 0.7.0 | 10.8.1 - 10.8.9 |
| 0.6.0 | 10.8.1 - 10.8.9 |
| 0.5.0 | 10.8.0 |
| <0.5.0 | 10.7.x |

> Note: Versions prior to 0.7.0 were published as `@thornbill/jellyfin-sdk`.

### React Native

The generated Axios client used in this library depends on `URL` and `URLSearchParams` to be available on the global scope.
React Native only includes incomplete implementations for these classes, so a polyfill is required.
[React Native URL Polyfill](https://github.com/charpeni/react-native-url-polyfill) seems like a good solution for this.

## Usage

```js
// Create a new instance of the SDK
const jellyfin = new Jellyfin({
    clientInfo: {
        name: 'My Client Application',
        version: '1.0.0'
    },
    deviceInfo: {
        name: 'Device Name',
        id: 'unique-device-id'
    }
});

// Find a valid server by trying to connect using common protocols and ports.
// Each server receives a score based on security, speed, and other criteria.
const servers = await jellyfin.discovery.getRecommendedServerCandidates('demo.jellyfin.org/stable');
// A utility function for finding the best result is available.
// If there is no "best" server, an error message should be displayed.
const best = jellyfin.discovery.findBestServer(servers);

// Create an API instance
const api = jellyfin.createApi(best.address);

// Each API endpoint is represented by a class in the generated client.
// Helper utility functions are provided under `/lib/utils/api/` to create an
// instance of a specific Jellyfin API using the shared Configuration and Axios
// instance from the `api` object created above.

// For example, the SystemApi can be generated using the `getSystemApi`
// function in `/lib/utils/api/system-api`.

// Fetch the public system info
const info = await getSystemApi(api).getPublicSystemInfo();
console.log('Info =>', info.data);

// Fetch the list of public users
const users = await getUserApi(api).getPublicUsers();
console.log('Users =>', users.data);

// A helper method for authentication has been added to the SDK because
// the default method exposed in the generated Axios client is rather
// cumbersome to use.
const auth = await api.authenticateUserByName('demo', '');
console.log('Auth =>', auth.data);

// Authentication state is stored internally in the Api class, so now
// requests that require authentication can be made normally
const libraries = await getLibraryApi(api).getMediaFolders();
console.log('Libraries =>', libraries.data);

// A helper method for logging out the current user has been added to the
// SDK so the internal state is updated correctly.
await api.logout();
```

## Breaking Changes

### v0.8.0

* The library is now fully targeted to ES6/ES2015.
  [#341](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/341)
* Axios received a major version upgrade.
  [#300](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/300)

### v0.7.0

* Renamed package to @jellyfin/sdk.
  [#262](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/262)

### v0.6.0

* Updated OpenAPI spec for Jellyfin 10.8.1.
  [#208](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/208)

### v0.5.0

* Build directory is now `lib` instead of `dist`.
  Any imports used that were previously in `dist` will need updated.
  [#147](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/147)
* Duplicated exports were removed.
  Any imports may need updated if you referenced one of the duplicates.
  [#148](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/148)
* API classes are no longer exposed via getters.
  Instead you need to call a function passing the `Api` instance as a parameter.
  For example: `getSystemApi(api)`.
  While I do feel this is a slightly worse developer experience, it was a necessary change to support tree-shaking.
  [#149](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/149)
* `BaseItemKind` is now included in the generated client.
  Imports will need updated.
  [#187](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/187)

## Roadmap to 1.0

* [x] Use custom generator templates for API versions [#231](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/231) (Currently uses sed to update the value could be improved.)
* [x] Automate OpenAPI spec updates using GitHub [#351](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/351)
* [x] Create branch tracking unstable Jellyfin builds with automated builds [#354](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/pull/354)
* [ ] Fix authentication header escaping
* [ ] Add WebSocket API support
* [ ] Add example projects for different ecosystems [#186](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/issues/186)
* [ ] Add utility function for `getFile` [#164](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-sdk-typescript/issues/164)
* [ ] More complete device profile generation utilities
